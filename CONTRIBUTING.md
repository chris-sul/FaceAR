# Contributing

Just some things to help with making sure that we don't tread over each others code while working on the project

## Making Code Changes

1. Make sure when making changes to just make your own branch so we all aren't pushing to master and the project breaks
2. After committing the changes push your branch and make a pull request and I can just deal with any git diff stuff so master is always a working version

** Try to commit often (after like each feature addition or bug fix) so that if stuff gets messed up we have versions to go back to versus just rebasing the code With that try to make informative commit messages so we don't have to dig around to figure out what the code does **

## Style

Doesn't really matter that much but just try to make sure that if you are editing a file that already exists try to stick to whatever style was in it so that the code is readable

## Bugs

1. If you guys are messing around or testing the code and something is broken and you have no idea how to fix it make an issue in github so we can all try to fix it
